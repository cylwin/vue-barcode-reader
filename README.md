# Vue Barcode and QR code scanner

<!--
[![npm version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/@teckel/vue-barcode-reader)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@teckel/vue-barcode-reader)
-->

A Vue.js set of components to scan (or upload images) barcodes and QR codes.

## Enhancements in this fork

* Fixes ZXing library version issue causing scanning to be very slow
* On startup, the library searches all available rear-facing cameras to find the most ideal camera for barcode scanning, preferrably one with torch (flash) and autofocus.  It also saves this ideal camera to local storage for faster startup on repeat scans.
* Adds the ability to activate the torch (camera flash), which can yield higher barcode scanning speed and accuracy.
* Ability to set orientation to landscape mode, this can also increase the scanning speed and accuracy as there's more pixels in the landscape orientation.
* Ability to control the camera zoom (if camera device reports the user is allowed to set the zoom).
* Ability to switch between autofocus and manual focus mode (defaults to autofocus mode if available).
* Ability to set the focus distance (if in manual focus mode and camera device supports the feature).

## Benefits

- Can scan both barcodes and QR codes
- Uses [ZXing](https://github.com/zxing-js/library) ("zebra crossing"), an open-source, multi-format 1D/2D barcode image processing library implemented in Java, with ports to other languages.

## Installation

The easiest way to use Vue Barcode Reader is to install it from **npm** or **yarn**.

```sh
npm install @teckel/vue-barcode-reader --save
```

Or

```sh
yarn add @teckel/vue-barcode-reader
```

### Vue 2.0 support

For Vue 2.0 compatible version please use the `vue-barcode-reader@0.0.3`.

## Usage

The Vue Barcode Reader works out of the box by just including it.

### Using Video Camera

Once a stream from the users camera is loaded, it's displayed and continuously scanned for barcodes. Results are indicated by the decode event.

```js
import { StreamBarcodeReader } from "@teckel/vue-barcode-reader";
```

In your template you can use this syntax:

```html
<StreamBarcodeReader @decode="onDecode" @loaded="onLoaded" torch></StreamBarcodeReader>
```

### Scanning from Image

The component renders to a simple file picker input element. Clicking opens a file dialog. On supporting mobile devices the camera is started to take a picture. The selected images are directly scanned and positive results are indicated by the `decode` event.

```js
import { ImageBarcodeReader } from "vue-barcode-reader";
```

In your template you can use this syntax:

```html
<ImageBarcodeReader @decode="onDecode" @error="onError"></ImageBarcodeReader>
```

```html
methods: { onDecode (result) { console.log(result) } }
```


## Props

> Props will only work if the camera reports that the feature is supported.  Some camera devices and some platforms either don't allow setting constraints or don't report the feature exists.  Chrome on Android work quite well, while (as expected) iOS and Safari don't support most/all features.

### torch

Activate the torch (flash). Can be set with simply `torch` or controlled via `:torch="torch"`.

### zoom

Set the zoom value (min/max/step available in `hasZoom` emitted value).

### landscape

Set the browser to landscape orientation.  In order to set landscape mode, the browser will first switch to fullscreen mode (this is required to force landscape mode).

### autofocus

Defaults to `true`, but setting `:autofocus="false"` turns off autofocus (manual focus).

### focusDistance

> Must have `:autofocus="false"` (turning off autofocus and turning on manual focus) for focusDistance to work.

Set the focus distance (min/max/step available in `hasFocusDistance` emited value).


## Emitted values

### hasTorch

Returns `true` or `false` if camera device reports it's capable of activating the torch (flash).

### hasAutofocus

Returns `true` or `false` if camera device reports it's capable of autofocus mode.

### hasZoom

Returns `false` or object containing `min`, `max`, `step` set from the supported camera decice.

### hasFocusDistance

Returns `false` or object containing `min`, `max`, `step` set from the supported camera decice.


## Events

### loaded

When the libraty is loaded and the camera is ready to scan

### decode

When a barcode or QR code is scanned. The result is passed as a parameter to the event handler. The result is the text encoded in the barcode or QR code.

### result

When a barcode or QR code is scanned. The result is passed as a parameter to the event handler. Below is an example result object from the UPC code of a box of Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats:

```
{
    "text": "038000199349",
    "rawBytes": null,
    "numBits": 0,
    "resultPoints": [
        {
            "x": 189,
            "y": 240
        },
        {
            "x": 445.5,
            "y": 240
        }
    ],
    "format": 14,
    "timestamp": 1690401753332,
    "resultMetadata": null
}
```
